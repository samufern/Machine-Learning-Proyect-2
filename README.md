# Machine Learning Project 2

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **classifying stars using machine learning**. The dataset has been processed using **one-hot encoding** and **ordinal encoding** techniques to improve model performance.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required dependencies (install using `requirements.txt` if available)

Install dependencies using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🔧 Installation
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Machine-Learning-Project-2.git
cd Machine-Learning-Project-2
```

## 🏗 Project Structure
```
Machine-Learning-Project-2/
│── Stars2.csv                 # Original dataset
│── stars_data_one_hot.csv      # Preprocessed dataset (one-hot encoding)
│── stars_data_ordinal.csv      # Preprocessed dataset (ordinal encoding)
│── modelo_2.ipynb              # Machine learning model development
```

## 🎯 Usage

### Running the Model
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```sh
jupyter notebook modelo_2.ipynb
```

## ✅ Testing
Use `modelo_2.ipynb` to test different classification models and evaluate their accuracy.
